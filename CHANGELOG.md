# Changelog

## Unreleased

### P1-DEV-001 local platform foundation (independent review Pending)

- Added isolated environment/resource/provider guards, approved-field telemetry, SLI reporting and a local synthetic alert receiver test.
- Added Neon PostgreSQL 17 event-scoped transactions, separate non-owner roles, immutable controlled migrations, transport RLS/column controls and leased/idempotent Cron/Queue delivery with explicit retries/DLQs.
- Added consistent-snapshot AES-256-GCM export, isolated authenticated restore, synthetic probe seed/reset, target deployment locks and versioned artifact/compatibility/dry-build tooling.
- Added real PostgreSQL and local workerd Cron/Queue E2E checks to the existing application CI and local commit gate; added a loopback-only k6 liveness smoke and setup/handoff evidence.
- Fixed CI's missing PostgreSQL 17 client package by configuring the official signed PGDG source before the fallback installation; repository regression checks reject missing or unauthenticated sources.
- User selected local completion. No company provisioning/deployment, hosted database/alert/rollback proof, domain completion or phase acceptance is implied.

### Security automation (independent review Pending)

- Added checksum-pinned free Opengrep/Gitleaks scans, fixed vendored rules, live official Node security checks and real scanner negative controls.
- Added local commit gates, daily two-branch security workflow and weekly dependency/action update PR configuration. Scheduled/default-branch activation still requires reviewed integration into main.
- Removed moderate esbuild/uuid findings using narrow parent/version overrides, with actual Drizzle transform, esbuild CORS, UUID bounds and Xcode parser/writer regressions. Every unremediated severity now blocks dependency verification; two existing proven local high patches remain visible.
- Prepared required-check/review branch policies. GitHub rejected access/entitlement: this private repository needs an eligible plan and repository-admin activation. No remote protection, reviewer approval, phase acceptance or production deployment is claimed.

### Added

- Repository-wide AGENTS instructions and contributor/security guidance.
- Reviewed current master, phase/member plans, canonical QA cases and integrated review.
- Architecture/ADR, data/security, development, testing, operations and handover documentation.
- GitHub PR/issue/CODEOWNERS templates and pinned documentation-check workflow.
- Portable repository/document checker and explicit readiness registers.

### Status

Application starter and local platform implementation exist with the scoped evidence above. No released version, company production deployment, provider approval or phase acceptance is claimed. Record subsequent changes with R/package IDs and actual validation evidence.

## 2026-10-19 — Initial application starter

- Added pinned pnpm/Node monorepo with public/workspace/mobile previews, separate local Workers, shared typed boundaries and real application CI.
- Added integer/HTTP tests, Chromium/local-workerd smoke tests and explicit unavailable/readiness behavior; no live provider actions.
- Kept reviewed requirements, six-member work assignments, branches and Tinu cases unchanged. Recorded the user-authorized initial main/dev baseline exception. All business features and phase acceptance remain Pending.

## 2026-10-19 — Toolchain security follow-up (review Pending)

- Added exact-version pnpm source patches for the two high Expo-toolchain findings, preserving all direct versions, stack choices, company requirements and team assignments.
- Added real-library signature/glob regressions and fail-closed proof-policy controls. Original vulnerable libraries failed nine cases before patching; the 15 library tests passed after patching.
- Replaced the registry-only dependency decision with installed-source/patch/advisory proof plus executed regressions and a fresh full scan. Raw findings remain visible and are retained as a CI artifact; moderate findings remain Open.
- Fixed the Linux documentation failure `P1-TIN-001: missing member task`: the checker now selects the six exact member documents instead of an order-dependent name glob that could choose Tinu's standalone test manual. Added a reversed-order regression test.
- GitHub's Actions incident delayed result publication. Remote verification and independent senior review remain required before merge.
